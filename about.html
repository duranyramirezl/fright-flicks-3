            <h1>About us</h1> 
            <p> In this podcast, we dive deep into the chilling narratives and 
                unsettling visuals of films from studios like A24. We've read countless 
                reviews and possess extensive knowledge in this area, which has helped us build 
                experience in the horror film industry. We don't just focus on success; we are genuinely 
                committed to connecting with every listener, ensuring they feel acknowledged. We listen to 
                their opinions and aim to expand our vision. What sets us apart is that we are still very 
                young and have a distinctive sense of fashion, music preferences, and a unique way of thinking. 
                “We don't want to be part of the demographic. We want to be individuals. That's why we even 
                cherish bad reviews. If the critics start liking our opinions, then we're in deep trouble.” 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This is what makes us inspiring to people who are also searching for their identity 
                and voice in this world. We believe that every frame tells a story and every sound amplifies the terror. 
                Overall, a movie is not just its visuals—it's the story, the perspective, the pacing, the silence, and the music. 
                Together, we'll dissect the artistry behind the scares, exploring how photography, sound design, and composition create an atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll. Join us as we celebrate the craft of horror and uncover the psychological 
                depths that keep us on the edge of our seats. Let’s discover what makes these 
                films truly spine-chilling!

        <p> Hi, I’m a 17-year-old girl passionate about film. 
            I would describe myself as an alternative person who doesn’t fit into societal norms. 
            Over time, I’ve developed a distinct perspective that has drawn me to horror films as 
            a form of self-expression. Due to my interest in both 
            music and the craft of horror filmmaking, we place a strong 
            emphasis on the cinematography of the movies we review. </p>
         <h3>⁺˚⋆｡°✩ Lucius ✩°｡⋆˚⁺</h3>

            me to explore the most innovative and thougt-provoking 
            films, particularly those that delve into contemporary
